As my internship at JPMorgan Chase comes to an end, I want to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you. This journey has been incredibly rewarding, filled with immense learning and growth. The supportive and welcoming culture here made me feel at home from day one.
To my engineering director, Suresh, our weekly intern-connect meetings were highlights I eagerly looked forward to. Your mentorship and advice have been instrumental in shaping my understanding of the industry and guiding my personal and professional growth. Your support has been invaluable, and I will cherish the learningd I've gained from you.
I would like to extend my deepest thanks to my manager, Amit, for your unwavering support and guidance throughout this experience. Your approachability and insights have greatly enhanced my learning.
Gauri, my buddy, and the entire Legal KM team – Soumik, Prabhjyot, Prasad, Jyotika, Sushma, and Sanchit – your encouragement and assistance were crucial in navigating various tasks in our project. I deeply appreciate your help.
A huge thank you to Rutwik and Yaman for the incredible opportunity to work on a real-life problem in data analytics. It gave me a glimpse into a new domain, and I have learned a lot.
